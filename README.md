Find My Pibble 

A web application that helps users look for adoptable pitbull breeds to bring into their homes aside from the pitbull stigma. I chose this project because I have a passion for this breed since I adopted my pitbull and have researched and learned the statistics regarding pitbull breeds. I wanted to create a site that shows my skills along with showing the loveable breed. 

Features
- Integration with Petfinder API to fetch real-time adoptable pitbull breeds. 
- Responsive design with CSS Grid for desktop and mobile layouts. 
- Interactive adoption form with email validation using regex.
- Rendering of dogs from API response using array and objects.

 I used JavaScript to load the data and display it, and CSS Grid to make the layout responsive on phones and computers. I also added a short bio, an adoption interest form with email validation, and some basic stats. To run this project, you’ll need to create a file called 'app.js' in the same folder as 'index.html.' In that file, add your own Petfinder API credentials by defining 'clientid' and 'clientsecret' as variables. Then paste in the rest of the JavaScript logic. For security, my 'app.js' file is not included in this repository. You can get your own API keys by signing up at petfinder.com/developers and inserting them into your version of 'app.js'. Once that’s done, just open 'index.html' in your browser to use the site.

I used ChatGPT and Google to help me figure out problems, understand how to use the Petfinder API, and clean up my code and styling. The project idea, layout, and final code were all put together by me.
